# Power spectrum emulators from the Quijote simulations

This project aims to build emulators for the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales in two extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model:
- massive neutrinos and dark energy, via the total neutrino mass and the dark energy equation of state;
- primordial equilateral non-Gaussianity.

Emulators are models trained on N-body simulatios of the Universe, that can predict cosmological observables without the user having to run the simulations. In this project, I am focussing on predicting the two-point correlation function in Fourier space (power spectrum), a key cosmological observable widely used to constrain models in the field.
